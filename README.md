# What is ired.team?

This is publicly accessible personal notes at [https://ired.team](https://ired.team) and [https://github.com/mantvydasb/RedTeam-Tactics-and-Techniques](https://github.com/mantvydasb/RedTeam-Tactics-and-Techniques) about my pentesting / red teaming experiments in a controlled environment that involve playing with various tools and techniques used by penetration testers, red teams and actual adversaries.

This is my way of learning things - by doing, following, tinkering, exploring, repeating and taking notes.

At ired.team, I will explore some of the common offensive security techniques involving gaining code execution, code injection, defense evasion, lateral movement, persistence and more.

Most of these techniques are discovered by other security researchers and I do not claim their ownership. I try to reference the sources I use the best I can, but if you think I've missed something, please get in touch and I will fix it immediately.

## The Goal

The goal of this project is simple - read other researchers work, execute some common/uncommon attacking techniques in a lab environment, do my own reasearch and:

* understand how various cyber attacks and techniques can be executed and how they work
* learn about how malware is written
* write code to further understand the tools and techniques used by attackers and malware authors
* learn more about C++, Windows internals and Windows APIs
* see what artifacts the techniques and tools leave behind on the endpoint
* try out various industry tools for pentesting, coding, debugging, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and become more profficient in using them
* take notes for future reference
